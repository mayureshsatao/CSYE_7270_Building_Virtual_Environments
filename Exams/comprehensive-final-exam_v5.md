# Answer Key

### Question 1
**Correct Answer**: Dynamic Body with hinge joint  
> **Explanation**: A pendulum requires physical simulation to swing realistically under gravity and respond to forces. A Dynamic Body (Rigidbody) with a hinge joint allows for physically accurate pendulum motion while constraining rotation to a single axis.

### Question 2
**Correct Answer**: FixedUpdate()  
> **Explanation**: FixedUpdate() is called at fixed time intervals synchronized with the physics system, making it ideal for applying physics forces. This ensures consistent force application regardless of frame rate fluctuations, unlike Update() which varies with frame rate.

### Question 3
**Correct Answer**: One object has isTrigger enabled  
> **Explanation**: When a collider has isTrigger enabled, it will generate OnTriggerEnter instead of OnCollisionEnter events. Triggers allow objects to overlap without creating physical collision responses, but still detect the intersection.

### Question 4
**Correct Answer**: To define how 2D textures map onto 3D surfaces  
> **Explanation**: UV unwrapping is the process of creating a 2D representation of a 3D model's surface, defining how texture coordinates (U and V) map onto the 3D geometry. This allows texture images to be correctly applied to models.

### Question 5
**Correct Answer**: Whether the material uses metal or dielectric reflectance properties  
> **Explanation**: In PBR, the metallic parameter determines if a surface follows metallic or non-metallic (dielectric) reflectance models. Metals reflect light differently than non-metals, with colored specular reflections and fully absorbing diffuse light.

### Question 6
**Correct Answer**: Visual scripting allows for rapid prototyping without compilation  
> **Explanation**: Unreal Engine's Blueprint visual scripting system allows developers to create gameplay elements without writing code, enabling rapid prototyping and iteration without the need for compilation steps that traditional C++ development requires.

### Question 7
**Correct Answer**: Lists  
> **Explanation**: Lists in C# are dynamic arrays that resize when elements are added or removed. This resizing operation creates temporary objects and can lead to garbage collection when performed frequently, which can cause performance hitches in games.

### Question 8
**Correct Answer**: To set up the Blueprint's components and properties at design time and when spawned  
> **Explanation**: The Construction Script in Unreal Engine Blueprints runs in the editor when the Blueprint is modified and when the actor is spawned in-game. It's used to set up components, calculate properties, and perform other initialization tasks.

### Question 9
**Correct Answer**: Inverse Kinematics (IK)  
> **Explanation**: Inverse Kinematics is a technique that calculates joint positions based on a target position. For foot placement, IK can dynamically adjust leg joint rotations to ensure feet connect properly with uneven terrain instead of floating or penetrating through it.

### Question 10
**Correct Answer**: To blend smoothly between different animation states  
> **Explanation**: Transitions in animation state machines control how the character moves from one animation state to another. They typically include blending settings that determine how gradually one animation morphs into another, preventing abrupt, unnatural changes.

### Question 11
**Correct Answer**: Collision Module  
> **Explanation**: The Collision Module in Unity's Particle System allows particles to interact with scene geometry, enabling effects like sparks bouncing off surfaces or dust settling on objects.

### Question 12
**Correct Answer**: Using animated textures instead of individual particles  
> **Explanation**: Flipbook animations (animated textures) are more efficient for complex effects like fire. They reduce the number of particles needed by displaying flame animation in the texture itself rather than requiring many particles to create the illusion of flames.

### Question 13
**Correct Answer**: It enables easier animation of separate body parts  
> **Explanation**: Skeletal animation uses a hierarchy of bones that can be animated independently, making it easy to animate different body parts separately (like arms and legs). This creates more complex animations than vertex animation, which directly manipulates mesh vertices.

### Question 14
**Correct Answer**: Ragdoll physics  
> **Explanation**: Ragdoll physics simulates physically-based body movement by applying forces to a jointed system of rigid bodies representing the character's skeleton. This creates realistic falling, tumbling, and impact reactions that would be difficult to animate manually.

### Question 15
**Correct Answer**: Inverse Kinematics (IK)  
> **Explanation**: Inverse Kinematics calculates limb positions based on target endpoints. For weapon gripping, IK adjusts the hand and arm joints to precisely align with different weapon handles, regardless of their size or position, creating natural-looking poses.

### Question 16
**Correct Answer**: Parameter-driven sound synthesis  
> **Explanation**: Parameter-driven sound synthesis dynamically generates or modifies audio based on game parameters. For vehicle engines, the sound can be tied to RPM values, allowing the pitch and intensity to smoothly change with vehicle speed for a realistic experience.

### Question 17
**Correct Answer**: Audio spatialization  
> **Explanation**: Audio spatialization creates the perception that sounds originate from specific locations in 3D space. It uses techniques like HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function), stereo panning, volume attenuation by distance, and Doppler effects to convince players of sound directionality.

### Question 18
**Correct Answer**: Using instanced rendering for repeated objects  
> **Explanation**: Instanced rendering allows multiple copies of the same mesh to be drawn with a single draw call instead of one per object. This significantly reduces draw calls for scenes with repetitive elements like trees, props, or enemies that share the same mesh.

### Question 19
**Correct Answer**: Balancing path length with calculation speed  
> **Explanation**: The A* (A-star) algorithm combines the thoroughness of Dijkstra's algorithm with the speed of a greedy best-first search by using a heuristic to estimate remaining distance. This balance makes it efficient for games, finding optimal or near-optimal paths without exhaustively checking all possibilities.

### Question 20
**Correct Answer**: Rendering priority  
> **Explanation**: Navigation meshes (NavMeshes) define walkable areas for AI pathfinding and include parameters like agent size, walkable slopes, jump distances, and area costs. Rendering priority is a graphics concept unrelated to navigation meshes, which are primarily for gameplay logic rather than visual rendering.

### Question 21
**Correct Answer**: To avoid the performance cost of instantiating and destroying objects  
> **Explanation**: Object pooling reuses objects instead of repeatedly creating and destroying them. This improves performance by avoiding the memory allocation/deallocation overhead of instantiation, which can cause frame rate hitches, especially during intense gameplay with many objects (like projectiles or enemies).

### Question 22
**Correct Answer**: Parallel processing of large data sets  
> **Explanation**: Compute shaders leverage the GPU's massively parallel architecture to process large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them ideal for calculations involving many elements like particle systems, cloth simulation, or large-scale terrain modification that would be inefficient on the CPU.

### Question 23
**Correct Answer**: Dynamic difficulty adjustment  
> **Explanation**: Dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) continuously monitors player performance and automatically adjusts game parameters (enemy stats, resource availability, etc.) to maintain an appropriate challenge level, keeping players in a "flow state" between boredom and frustration.

### Question 24
**Correct Answer**: Using a MonoBehaviour with DontDestroyOnLoad  
> **Explanation**: For Unity singletons, a MonoBehaviour with DontDestroyOnLoad() is generally recommended as it allows the object to persist between scene loads while still having access to Unity's component system and event functions, unlike static classes which cannot use MonoBehaviour functionality.

### Question 25
**Correct Answer**: To identify performance bottlenecks  
> **Explanation**: A profiler in game development is a diagnostic tool that monitors and analyzes performance metrics like CPU usage, memory allocation, rendering time, and physics calculations. This helps developers identify bottlenecks causing performance issues and optimize the most problematic areas of the game.
